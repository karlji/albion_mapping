# Albion Mapping

## Description
This is a simple script I created for the online game **Albion Online**, specifically for the content called **Roads of Avalon**. In the Roads of Avalon, there is a constantly changing set of maps with portals that randomly open and close between them. Since the game is full loot PvP, staying in one place for too long poses a significant risk.

To address this challenge, I developed a script that allows quick screenshot capturing of the minimap using a shortcut. It also enables capturing portal information such as the destination and travel time while moving through the zone. I utilized these screenshots to create a diagram and build a map of the connections between portals.

## Discontinuation
I eventually discontinued this project as several more sophisticated projects emerged that provided better mapping solutions.

Feel free to use and modify this script as per your needs.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please let me know!
